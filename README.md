# Voter and Membership Eligibility Checker

## Overview

This is a Python-based project that determines voter eligibility based on a user's age and citizenship. It also checks if the user is a member of a club and provides additional information depending on their membership status and age.

The project showcases the use of decision structures (like `if`, `if-else`, `if-elif-else`), Boolean logic, logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`), and nested decision-making.

## Features

- **Voter Eligibility**: Check if the user is eligible to vote based on their age and citizenship.
- **Club Membership**: Verify if the user is a member of the club and offer benefits depending on age.
- **Decision Structures**: Demonstrates the use of multiple decision structures.
- **Boolean Logic**: Uses Boolean variables to track membership status.
- **Logical Operators**: Combines conditions with logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`).
